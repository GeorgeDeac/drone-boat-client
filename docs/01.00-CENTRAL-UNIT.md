# Central Unit
The main computer on the drone boat is a Raspberry Pi. All software runs 'bare metal' without any virtualisation.

## Dependencies
- **[Redis](https://redis.io/)** is a memcache, used to store data in the memory of the raspberry pi.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** is the runtime environment of the main application.
- **[PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/)** is a Node.js process manager to run a Node.js app on system boot.
- **[hostapd]()** is a wifi accesspoint 
- **[dnsmasq]()** is a dns and dhcp server

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 3b
- down converter from 12V to 5V with over 2A

## Sub Units
A sub unit is a group of components, of modules like sensor modules or motor driver and
one NodeMCU. The NodeMCU is here the "mini brain". A controller for the connected shields.
On this mini brain runs software from the folder: `nodemcu/`
