# Movement

## Hardware
- 1 x NodeMCU as mini brain
- 2 x BTS7960B Motordriver
- 1 x DC Down Converter
- 1 x Klemmschiene for 3 Consumers and 1 Input ( = 4 Connections)

## Stuff
I used a `plexi glas plate`, `1 cm spacer` and `2mm screws` to bring all pieces togther.

## Wiring
- PWM Motordriver Left
```
NodeMCU     D1    <-> LPWM BTS7960B  
NodeMCU     D2    <-> RPWM BTS7960B  
``` 
- PWM Motordriver Right
```
NodeMCU     D3    <-> LPWM BTS7960B  
NodeMCU     D4    <-> RPWM BTS7960B  
``` 
- Motodriver Power (both)
```
BTS7960B    L_EN  <-> 5V+  
BTS7960B    R_EN  <-> 5V+  
BTS7960B    VIN   <-> 5V+  
BTS7960B    GND   <-> none
```

## Software
Upload the sketch `nodemcu/moevement.ino` on the nodeMCU.

## Joystick Control and MQTT
The Joystick send MQTT payloads to the broker. The movement nodeMCU receive these messages and do it what it have to do. 
The nodeMCU app is very very stupid. There is no logic in it. All logic happens in the Node.js app.
  
The payload on the channel `movement` looks like this:

```
{
    "name":"throttle",
    "value":39,
    "side":{
        "left":39,
        "right":39
    }
}
```

The values here equals a range from `-100` to `100`. That means the joystick sends normalized values to the broker.
