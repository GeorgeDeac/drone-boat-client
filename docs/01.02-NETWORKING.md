# Networking

The RPi runs his own internal wifi module as accesspoint only for the NodeMCUs
and for a direct support access to the boat. The distance between the RPi
and the NodeMCUs is under one meter. The range of the internal wifi is not so much,
but enough for the internal communication.
 
The RPi is a **MQTT Broker**, **Websocket** and **Rest API Server** for his
**wifi accesspoint (AP) clients**  (the NodeMCUs).  

And the RPi is a **wifi client** with the Base Unit. For this we use a second usb wifi module,
plugged directly on the raspberry pi.
 
No network wires needed to communicate with the sub units.

## Network Interfaces
The app hooks the dns resolving. That means, when the app is starting, the `/etc/resolv.conf`
file will be replaced with the local nameserver: `nameserver 127.0.0.1`.
If the app is shutting down, the app restore the previous `resolv.conf` content with
a `resolvconf -u`.

## Network Setup
```
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```
use this:
```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
 
auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
 
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
  address 192.168.100.100
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  network 192.168.100.0
  broadcast 192.168.100.255
```



## Wifi Accesspoint
With the previous setup, hostapd is installed and its service is disabled.
The app runs the hostapd binary.
 
All hostapd configuration stuff under `[accesspoint]` and `[accesspoint.config]` in:
```
app/config/default.conf
``` 

The app is creating a normally `hostapd.conf` file in:
```
app/config/run/hostapd.conf
```
To change the SSID or login credentials, edit the app config and change the `ssid`, `wpa_passphrase`.


## DNS Server with dnsmasq
With the previous setup, dnsmasq is installed and its service is disabled.
The reason for this is, that the main Node.js runs the dnsmasq binary.
That means, the dns server starts with the app - not with a system boot.
 
All dnsmasq configuration stuff under `[dns]` and `[dns.config]`in:
```
app/config/default.conf
``` 
The app is creating a normally `dnsmasq.conf` file in:
```
app/config/run/dnsmasq.conf
```
The dns names for the sub unit devices (the NodeMCUs) are stored in:
```
app/config/run/addresses/droneboat.conf
```
actually with this content: *but not used*
```
address=/droneboat/192.168.100.100
address=/move.droneboat/192.168.100.110
address=/dolly.droneboat/192.168.100.120
address=/air.droneboat/192.168.100.130
address=/water.droneboat/192.168.100.140
```
