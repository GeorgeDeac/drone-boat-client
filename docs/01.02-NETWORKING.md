# Networking

The RPi runs his own internal wifi module as accesspoint only for the NodeMCUs
and for a direct support access to the boat. The distance between the RPi
and the NodeMCUs is under one meter. The range of the internal wifi is not so much,
but enough for the internal communication.
 
The RPi is a **Websocket** and **Rest API Server** for his **wifi accesspoint (AP) clients**  (the NodeMCUs).
And the RPi is a **wifi client** with the Base Unit. For this we use a second usb wifi module,
plugged directly on the raspberry pi.
 
No network wires needed to communicate with the sub units.
